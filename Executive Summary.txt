Craft.Core              ✅ Core abstractions (ICurrentUser, ITenant, PageInfo, Result<T>)

Option B: Expand Significantly (if keeping separate)

Issue #5: Craft.Expressions and Craft.QuerySpec Overlap
Current Situation:

Craft.Expressions/
├── Engine/
│   ├── ExpressionStringParser.cs    (Parse string → AST)
│   ├── ExpressionTreeBuilder.cs     (AST → Expression<T>)
│   └── Tokenizer.cs                 (String → Tokens)
└── ExpressionSerializer.cs          (Serialize/deserialize expressions)

Craft.QuerySpec/
├── Core/
│   ├── Query<T>.cs                  (Query specification)
│   ├── EntityFilterBuilder<T>.cs   (Build filter expressions)
│   └── SortOrderBuilder<T>.cs      (Build sort expressions)
└── Uses Craft.Expressions internally

Problems:
•	⚠️ Unclear separation of concerns
•	⚠️ Users confused about which to use
•	⚠️ Craft.QuerySpec depends on Craft.Expressions
Analysis: Actually, this is ACCEPTABLE as-is with better documentation:
Project	Purpose	When to Use
Craft.Expressions	Low-level expression manipulation	Building dynamic LINQ, custom parsers
Craft.QuerySpec	High-level query specification	Repository patterns, filtering, sorting
Recommended Solution: Keep Separate but improve documentation

// Craft.Expressions/README.md
# When to Use
- Building dynamic LINQ expressions from strings
- Creating custom query parsers
- Low-level expression tree manipulation
- Advanced scenarios requiring expression composition

# When NOT to Use
- Simple filtering/sorting → Use Craft.QuerySpec instead
- Repository patterns → Use Craft.QuerySpec instead

// Craft.QuerySpec/README.md  
# When to Use
- Implementing repository pattern
- Building dynamic queries in services
- Filtering, sorting, pagination
- Specification pattern implementations

# Under the Hood
Uses Craft.Expressions for advanced expression building

Action: Add cross-references in documentation, not code changes.

Issue #6: Craft.Auditing is Over-Specialized
Current State:

Craft.Auditing/
├── Attributes/
│   ├── AuditAttribute.cs
│   └── DoNotAuditAttribute.cs
├── Models/
│   └── AuditTrail.cs
├── Helpers/
│   └── AuditingHelpers.cs
└── Abstractions/
    └── IAuditTrailDbContext.cs

Problems:
•	⚠️ Narrow scope (just audit trails)
•	⚠️ Could be part of broader feature set
•	⚠️ Similar pattern to other cross-cutting concerns
Recommended Solution:
Option A: Create Craft.Domain.Features (Recommended for consolidation)

Craft.Domain.Features/
├── Auditing/
│   ├── AuditAttribute.cs           (from Craft.Auditing)
│   ├── AuditTrail.cs               (from Craft.Auditing)
│   └── AuditingHelpers.cs          (from Craft.Auditing)
├── SoftDelete/
│   ├── ISoftDelete.cs              (from Craft.Domain)
│   └── SoftDeleteExtensions.cs     (NEW)
├── Versioning/
│   ├── IHasVersion.cs              (from Craft.Domain)
│   └── VersioningExtensions.cs     (NEW)
├── MultiTenancy/
│   └── (reference to Craft.MultiTenant)
└── Timestamping/
    ├── IHasTimestamp.cs            (NEW or from Domain)
    └── TimestampExtensions.cs      (NEW)

Option B: Keep Separate (if you prefer high granularity)
Recommendation: Option A if you want consolidation, Option B if you prefer focused projects.
---
1.3 Consolidation Summary
Current: 24 Projects

Core (3) + Data Access (4) + Business (6) + Infrastructure (3) + 
Specialized (5) + Apps (1) + Tests (excluded)

Recommended: 15-18 Projects
Consolidation Plan:
Action	From	To	Impact
Merge	Craft.Controllers	Craft.HttpServices	🟡 Medium
Move	Craft.Utilities
Optional	Craft.Auditing	Craft.Domain.Features (new)	🟢 Low
Result: 19 Projects (24 - 1 delete + 3 new - 6 merged = ~20 projects, accounting for test organization)

2.2 Dependency Issues Identified
Issue #1: Craft.Core has EF Core Dependency

---
Issue #2: Circular Reference Risk with Craft.Infrastructure
Craft.Infrastructure → Craft.Utilities → (Test helpers)
                    → Craft.Exceptions
                    → Craft.Security → Craft.Core
                    → Craft.Core
Problem: Craft.Infrastructure has too many dependencies, creating potential circular references.
Solution: Already addressed by splitting Craft.Infrastructure into 3 projects.

7. Conclusion & Next Steps
Overall Assessment
Your Craft library is well-architected with excellent test coverage and modern patterns. The main issues are:
1.	Over-fragmentation (24 projects is too many)
2.	Infrastructure monolith (forces unnecessary dependencies)
3.	Missing critical features (caching, configuration)
Recommended Path Forward
Week 1-2: Critical reorganization
•	Split Craft.Infrastructure
•	Merge/consolidate small projects
•	Update documentation
Week 3-4: Add critical features
•	Craft.Caching
•	Craft.Configuration
Week 5-8: Enhanced features
•	Craft.Storage
•	Craft.BackgroundJobs
•	Craft.Validation
Beyond: Optional features based on user feedback
Your Next Action
Would you like me to:
1.	Generate detailed migration scripts for splitting Craft.Infrastructure?
2.	Create project templates for Craft.Caching and Craft.Configuration?
3.	Draft an architecture diagram showing the new structure?
4.	Prepare a GitHub migration guide for users of your library?
Let me know which you'd like to tackle first, and I'll provide detailed, executable guidance!

## 📋 Executive Summary

Your Craft library demonstrates **excellent architectural principles** with comprehensive test coverage, modern .NET 10 patterns, and production-ready implementations. However, there are **significant opportunities for consolidation** (24 projects → ~15-18), **dependency optimization**, and **missing enterprise features** that would elevate this from a good library to an exceptional one.

### Key Findings

| Category | Status | Count | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Foundation Projects** | ✅ Excellent | 3 | Keep as-is |
| **Over-Fragmented Projects** | ⚠️ Action Needed | 6 | Consolidate |
| **Well-Organized Projects** | ✅ Good | 9 | Minor improvements |
| **Missing Features** | ❌ Gaps Identified | 12 | Add new projects |
| **Dependency Issues** | ⚠️ Review Needed | 4 | Restructure |

**Overall Assessment**: 7.5/10 (Very Good, approaching Excellent with recommended changes)
